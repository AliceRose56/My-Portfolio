### This is a the 'Mixed Messages' project and here's the premise:

A company wants to open-source it's encryption functions by packaging its encryption functions in a module and allowing other developers to import these encryption functions into their own projects.

In this project, you help extract and isolate its encryption functions into a module, called encryptors.js, and then reuse this moduleâ€™s functions in your own super encryption program.

## What I learned from this:

1. About how to utilize user inputs to interact with your code
2. How to import/export code from other files 
3. That modular coding practices are important because they enable reusing code across multiple programs, while allowing you to update it across all instances by just editing one instance

*NOTE: To test this project in VS Code, right click the folder containing it, select 'Open in Integrated Terminal' then:*
- *if encrypting input "node super-encryptor.js encode" in a terminal, then enter your message when prompted.*
- *if decrypting input "node super-encryptor.js decode (encryption key you recieved previously)", then enter the encoded message when prompted*
