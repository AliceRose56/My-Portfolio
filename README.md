# My-Portfolio
Codecademy Back-End Engineer Career path Projects


## ***Here are the various types of projects in my portfolio:*** 

### Minor projects:
*There are two types of works that I consider **Minor Projects**, they are:*
- Normal projects that are *small* in scope
- Normal lessons I decided to turn into projects by delving much deeper into the topic than intended and challenging myself to fulfill some sort of vision or idea that I wanted to try

### Major projects:
*There are two types of works that I consider* ***Major Projects***, *they are:*
- Normal projects that are *large* in scope
- *Portfolio Projects*, these are *big* projects that occur at the end of each chapter of a course, which are the culmination of all the skills I aquired in that chapter

### Challenge projects: 
*Instead of a guided project format, this project type contain a series of open-ended requirements that must be met in order to be considered complete. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of those requirements.*

- #### These project folders contain: 
  - A text file contianing the premise and requirements of the project
   - one folder showing their intial setup
   - another folder with the completed project using my solutions to said requirements

<br><br>

*Note: **Major** and **Minor** projects tend to be done in a **guided format** with **step-by-step directions**, although some offer the extra challenge of doing a more **open-ended approach**, if I have chosen that extra challenge I will move them into the **Challenge project** folder*
