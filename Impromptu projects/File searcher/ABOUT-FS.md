I am going off script in a lesson on node.js because I really wanted to try an idea I had for a faster solution to the lesson. Here's the premise:

I am searching through files to find the secret word. The lesson would have you access each txt file one at a time, then manually change your code to use the new information you gleaned from each file, but I wanted to try an all-in-one-go approach to search each file in sequence to find the secret word with no script changes between.

What I learned from this:

1. About RegEx and how to use it to search through arrays/strings in JavaScript
2. How to access filesystems with Node.js
3. The importance and uses of Asyncronous programing

As a bonus, I got more experience in troubleshooting and utilizing various documentations to implement my ideas. Also I had fun learning this and developing my skills ^w^
